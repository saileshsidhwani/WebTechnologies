In this project, I've created a webpage that allows users to search items for sale on eBay.com using their APIand the results will be
displayed in a tabular format.

Once the user has provided valid data (a keyword is required), my script will make a request to your web server providing it with the 
form data that was entered. I've used GET to transfer the form data to the web server. A PHP script will retrieve the data and send 
it to the eBay API service “findItemsAdvanced”. The API call to eBay is done simply by a URL REST request
